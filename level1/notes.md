# Getting started with Angular

a simple, responsive app using angular and bootstrap.



## Directives

Directive are angular-specific attributes which are added to HTML tags to run or reference some JavaScript code.

A directive typically starts with the prefix `ng-`

## Modules

Individual pieces of an application are modules. This modular approach makes code more maintainable and easier to test. 

Modules can also include dependencies 


## Expressions

Expressions allow you to insert dynamic values into static HTML pages. You can recognise them by their double curly braces `{{ }}`

## Controllers

A controller is a piece of JavaScript that defines the functions and values available to your app. 

### Scope

It is worth pointing out that the scope of a controller is limited to the DOM element that references it.
